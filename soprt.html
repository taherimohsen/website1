          After a frantic first half, which at times lacked quality, the game
          burst into life in the second half with three goals in five dramatic
          minutes. Raphinha, who looked the most likely for Leeds all afternoon,
          opened the scoring with a superb individual effort in the 56th minute
          before Norwich responded straight away through Andrew Omobamidele's
          header (58). How the teams lined up | Match stats Premier League

          hosts as Ozan Kabak lost possession before Rodrigo's shot dipped past
          the outstretched arms of Tim Krul (60) to hand Leeds a much-needed
          victory. The win means Leeds, who started the day in the relegation
          places, move up to 17th, while the pressure increases on Daniel Farke
          as his side remain bottom and without a win in their opening 10
          top-flight matches this season. end
