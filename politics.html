                              war ended with the 
                               victory of Palestinian groups against the Zionist regime.

                               Tasnim News Agency Revolution History Group - Twelve years ago, Palestinian forces were able to achieve victory after 22 days of resistance against the attacks of the Zionist regime, hence the name of January 29 is Gaza Day.

                                During the 22-day war, the Zionist regime used a range of conventional and non-conventional weapons to defeat the people of Gaza and destroy the resistance. The title of the weapon of war in residential areas was announced as another cluster bomb used by Israel, which endangered the lives of civilians for a long time, even after the war, which the Red Cross called inhumane.
                                The economic and fuel blockade of the Gaza Strip was another measure taken by the Zionist regime, in which the only way to provide food and shelter was through UN humanitarian aid, and even the supply of drinking water was hampered. Seizure of the ship Rachel Corey from Ireland, which was carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, was among the passengers of the Nobel Peace Prize winner and a high-ranking UN representative, and the attack on the ship called the Freedom Caravan, which left Turkey and was carrying 581 activists. It was human rights, an example of the economic siege of Gaza by the Zionists.

                                Although the Zionists did their best to break the resistance in Gaza, they did not succeed, and in the end, the Palestinian forces and the Resistance Front succeeded.
